# JavaScript-Validation
This GitHub repository contains a single HTML page that includes several attributes such as UserName, Email, Contact, Password, Confirm Password, and Name. The page also includes JavaScript validation to ensure that the user input for these attributes meets the required criteria. This project can serve as a useful reference for developers who are looking to implement similar validation on their own HTML pages.
